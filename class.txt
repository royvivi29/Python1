Class is the template or the blueprint and an object is what is created using that template

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age 
    
    def sample_method(self):
        print(self.name.upper())

__init__ is always a reference to the specific object being created pr used.

object_1 = ClassName(attribute_1, attribute_2)
object_2 = ClassName(attribute_1, attribute_2)

you can call any of the method defined in the class from each object

object_1.method_name()
object_2.method_name()
