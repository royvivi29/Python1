Class is the template or the blueprint and an object is what is created using that template

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age 
    
    def sample_method(self):
        print(self.name.upper())

__init__ is always a reference to the specific object being created pr used.

object_1 = ClassName(attribute_1, attribute_2)
object_2 = ClassName(attribute_1, attribute_2)

you can call any of the method defined in the class from each object

object_1.method_name()
object_2.method_name()

Attribute
Attribute are variables that belong to an object, so they hold data.

there are two kinds of attribute:
instance attribute and class attribute

there are for special method are 
__init__()
__add__

__str__()

Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and others.
__add__()
__sub__()
__mul__()
__truediv__()

String operations like concatenation, repetition, formatting, and conversion to text.
__add__() is called for concatenation, __mul__() for repetition, __format__() for formatting, __str__() and __repr__() for text conversion, and so on.

Comparison operations like equality, less-than, greater-than, and others.
__eq__() is called for equality checks, __lt__() for less-than, __gt__() for greater-than, and so on.

Iteration operations like making an object iterable and advancing through items.
__iter__() is called to return an iterator and  __next__() to fetch the next item.
